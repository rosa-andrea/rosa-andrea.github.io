                                ParSim allows the reproduction of custom workloads in parallel systems.</p>

                                With ParSim, users can model workloads of parallel applications through a formal representation. This formalism has been developed to allow the modeling of parallel operations (like forks and joins of child processes) and operating patterns (like CPU- or I/O-intensive instructions).
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                ParSim can reproduce custom workloads in multicore and multiprocessor systems, generating graphical and textual information for further analysis, with special focus on the parallel behavior of the workload.
                                </p>
