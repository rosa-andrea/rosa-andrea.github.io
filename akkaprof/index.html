                                AkkaProf is a profiling tool for Akka actors. </p>

                                AkkaProf centers on two important characteristics of applications using actors: utilization and communication between them. To this end, the tool instruments every Akka actor created during the execution of an actor-based application.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                AkkaProf is implemented on top of the <a href="https://disl.ow2.org">DiSL</a> instrumentation framework, which ensures complete coverage of every executed bytecode. The integration with DiSL enables the accurate collection of platform-independent metrics (such as bytecode count) that characterize all actors spawned.
                                </p>

          <h3>Demo version</h3>
          
          <p> A demo version of AkkaProf can be downloaded <a href="http://www.inf.usi.ch/phd/rosaa/akkaprof-demo.zip">here</a>. </p>
          
          <p>
          The archive contains a virtual machine where AkkaProf and DiSL have been already set up and are ready to use. Additionally, the virtual machine includes sample workloads that are ready to be profiled with AkkaProf.
